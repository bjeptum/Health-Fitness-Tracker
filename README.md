### 🎉 About the Project

**[JengaFit](https://health-fitness-tracker-theta.vercel.app/)** is a web application used to track user fitness activities with health insights and visualization of progress over time.


### 🌈 The Context

Getting back into shape can be a challenge, especially while navigating major life changes like postpartum recovery(that’s me 😉) or achieving fitness goals (the recurring new year resolution for most of us😁). 

The journey began with the motivation of building an application on my own from scratch.

My goal was to deepen my learning as I pursued my path to becoming a software engineer through the [ALX -Software Engineering Foundations](https://www.alxafrica.com/learn/programming-development/) program.
